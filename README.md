# Eternity — Portfolio by Leccon1

**Strong Junior / Early Middle Frontend Developer**

Hi! I'm **Leccon1**, a 17-year-old frontend developer on my way to becoming a Senior. After 11 months of intense practice, I’ve built dozens of projects, mastered modern technologies, and created my own growth system. My path is all about discipline, grind, and love for clean, structured code.

* **HTML5** — semantics, accessibility, clean markup
* **Git & GitHub** — branching, Git Flow, commit optimization, automated deploy
* **Vite** — config customization, optimization, advanced setup

### **Tools & Environment**

* Arch Linux 🐧
* Bash scripts (including universal deployment scripts)
* Figma
* npm / pnpm

### **Currently Learning / Next Goals**

My goals with this project:

* showcase code quality
* demonstrate my design sense
* present carefully built interfaces
* show my engineering mindset, not just layout skills

## Skills I Continuously Improve

* UI/UX design principles
* Structuring large projects
* Creating custom component libraries
* Automation (scripts, deployment)
* Animations (including ⚡ Anime.js)
* Reading and understanding other developers’ code

## Projects & Demos

Here you’ll find my best work — from adaptive interfaces to full React applications.
Each project represents a new stage in my growth and the desire to write code that ages well.

## My Journey

I began learning web development in November 2024.
No courses, no mentors — only practice, documentation, experiments, and persistence.

I enjoy thinking like an engineer: building architecture, planning systems, and writing code I won’t be ashamed to revisit a year later.
